# welcome-screen-with-vuejs

## Brief
```
Project context
Implement simple vue.js page with data accessing from a google sheet api with axios.

​

Intructions

​

Day1:

minimum requirements:

create vue project
delete all the code and files from your vue project, which you don't need
commit to github
build the project layout as close as possible provided from the design
add html element
add css styling
the layout should support the dimensions: 1080 x 1920
commit to Github
​

further options for people who are done faster:

add responsive styling options
commit to Github
​

Day2:

add data() elements "title", "currentDate"
add site title
add function for getting currentDate and display it
commit to Github
add API
write method to get data from the API
display data from the API
commit to Github
​

Day3:

adjust valueRanges in the gsheet_url to remove first item in the array (do not show the titles)
commit to Github
add function to refresh data
add refreshData function to mounted()
commit to Github
​

Day4:

host your project on netlify:
https://app.netlify.com/start

add preview link of your netlify to your github repository
